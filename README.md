My project is a simple store. I build it to learn about routing in React.

## Features

-   simple design;
-   ERROR page;
-   search bar;

## Built with

-   Styled-components;
-   React;
-   React Router - A routing library for React;
-   **BrowserRouter** component;
-   **Route** and **Routes** components;
-   **Link** and **NavLink** components;

## Developer experience

-   learned about routing in React, URL string structure, discovered how the routing library works;
-   learned about the **BrowserRouter** component and used it. ( Using the context, it transmits information about the current state of the navigation history to all descendants. All we need is to wrap all applications with a `<BrowserRouter>` component.);
-   learned about `<Route> and <Routes>` components;
-   created navigation error page;
-   learned about `<Link> and <NavLink>` components;
-   learned about enclosed routes;
-   implemented subpage logic using nested routes. (Some URLs by which, in addition to the parent component of the entire page, some child, nested component will be displayed.);
-   Code separation :

	-   learned about bundling and how to to prevent bundle growth;
	-   learned about React.lazy and used it in project for optimization;
	-   learned about delay and how Suspense component works;
	-   Learned about how lazy works with suspense;

-   build a fakeAPI for project;
-   build a functional search in app;
-   styled app using CSS in JS.
